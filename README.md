# End-to-End-Machine-Learning-API-FastAPI-Scikit-Learn-

A demonstration of how to build and deploy a complete machine learning pipeline as a REST API using FastAPI.
This project focuses on architecture, scalability, and production-readiness, making it easy to swap in different datasets and models.

â¸»

ðŸ“Œ Features
	â€¢	Full ML Workflow
	â€¢	Data preprocessing & feature engineering (scikit-learn)
	â€¢	TF-IDF-based text vectorization
	â€¢	Model training & saving as a reusable pipeline (joblib)
	â€¢	Production-Ready FastAPI Backend
	â€¢	Clean, modular folder structure (routers, services, core configs)
	â€¢	/predict endpoint with Pydantic request/response models
	â€¢	Logging & Exception handling implemented
	â€¢	Easily Extensible
	â€¢	Can replace the current dataset or swap in advanced models like XGBoost or BERT without changing API logic.
